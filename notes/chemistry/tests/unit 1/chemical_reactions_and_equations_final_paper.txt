12. Neutralization reactions involve the exchange of ions between the acid and the base. The hydrogen ion (H+) from the acid combines with the hydroxide ion (OH-) from the base to form water, while the remaining cation from the base and anion from the acid combine to form a salt.

45. P4(s) + 5O2(g) -> 2P2O5(s)
46. The expected total mass of the products and the beaker would remain 150.0 g. This is because the reaction occurs in a closed system, and the Law of Conservation of Mass states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction; it is merely rearranged. Therefore, the total mass before and after the reaction must be conserved.
47. The Law of Conservation of Mass, primarily formulated by Antoine Lavoisier, shifted chemistry from a qualitative to a quantitative science. Before its acceptance, ideas like phlogiston theory (mass loss during burning) were prevalent. Lavoisier's meticulous experiments demonstrating mass conservation provided a fundamental principle, allowing chemists to accurately predict product masses, balance equations, and understand stoichiometry, thereby laying the groundwork for modern chemical theory and experimentation.
48. Total mass of products = Mass of lead(II) iodide + Mass of potassium nitrate solution = 23.0 g + 120.0 g = 143.0 g. Total mass of reactants = Mass of lead(II) nitrate solution + Mass of potassium iodide solution = 100.0 g + 50.0 g = 150.0 g. This does not align, which implies either the remaining solution mass given (120g) includes the mass of the precipitate that was separated, or it's a trick question where a portion of the potassium nitrate solution was also separated. Assuming the question meant 120.0 g *of only the potassium nitrate solution* was recovered after separation of precipitate: 150.0g (reactants) vs 143.0g (products). This implies some mass was unaccounted for or the numbers are not perfectly balanced for an ideal scenario. A more direct answer considering LCM: The total mass of products (including any gas or solution formed) must equal the total mass of the reactants if no substance escaped. Given 150.0 g of reactants, the total mass of products should also be 150.0 g.

93. A neutralization reaction is a chemical reaction in which an acid and a base react quantitatively with each other to form a salt and water.
94. (c)
95. This describes an exothermic reaction.

106. If a reaction is performed at an elevated temperature, especially above the boiling point of water (100 degrees C), water would exist as a gas (steam) rather than a liquid. Similarly, substances that are typically solid or liquid at room temperature might become liquids or gases, respectively, at higher temperatures. State symbols must then reflect these changes (e.g., H2O(g) instead of H2O(l)), as the physical state directly impacts the reaction's kinetics and mechanisms.

A closed system prevents matter exchange, ensuring that any mass change observed is due to the transformation of substances within the system, thus allowing for verification of mass conservation. Example: Burning magnesium in an open beaker. The mass of the solid product (magnesium oxide) will appear to be greater than the initial mass of magnesium because oxygen from the air (reactant) has been incorporated.
