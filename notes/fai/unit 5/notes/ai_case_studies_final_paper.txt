20. Few-shot learning (or in-context learning) refers to the capability of a large language model to learn a new task or concept and generate appropriate responses using only a small number of examples provided within the input prompt itself, without requiring any updates to the model's internal weights through traditional fine-tuning. This capability significantly reduces the need for extensive fine-tuning because the model can leverage its vast pre-trained knowledge and generalize from these few examples or instructions, rapidly adapting to new tasks based solely on the prompt's context.

29. A context-aware chatbot maintains a memory of previous turns in a conversation, allowing it to understand and respond to user queries that refer back to earlier information. A stateless chatbot treats each user input as an independent event, without recalling any prior interaction history. Example: If a user asks "What is the capital of France?" and then immediately asks "What language do they speak there?", a context-aware chatbot would know "there" refers to France, whereas a stateless chatbot would not and might ask for clarification or provide an irrelevant answer.

33. One potential ethical concern is the generation of biased or misleading information. Large language models are trained on vast datasets that may contain societal biases, leading them to produce responses that are discriminatory, reinforce stereotypes, or provide inaccurate "facts." In critical applications like medical or legal advice, this could have severe real-world consequences, from misdiagnosis to incorrect legal counsel.
34. (b)
35. (c)
36. A recommendation algorithm could significantly enhance the user experience by suggesting destinations, flight times, or even travel packages based on explicit user preferences, implicit patterns from past bookings, popular routes, or current deals. For example, if a user frequently searches for flights to beach destinations in winter, the chatbot could proactively suggest tropical getaways. If a user inputs a departure city, the algorithm could recommend popular or cost-effective destinations based on historical data. This proactive suggestion capability personalizes the booking process, making it more efficient and tailored to the user's potential interests.

Digital voice assistants handle ambiguity in user commands by employing strategies such as: 1) Asking clarifying questions: If the command is too vague (e.g., "Play some music"), the assistant might ask, "What genre of music would you like to hear?" or "Who is your favorite artist?". 2) Using default settings or user preferences: If no specific input is given, the assistant might default to a user's most listened-to genre or a popular playlist.
45. (b)
46. 1) Resolution Rate: This metric measures the percentage of user queries or issues that the chatbot successfully resolves completely without requiring human agent intervention. It indicates the chatbot's effectiveness and autonomy in handling user requests. 2) Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Score: Typically collected via a post-interaction survey (e.g., "How satisfied were you with this chat?"), this metric measures the user's perceived quality of the interaction and the helpfulness of the chatbot.
