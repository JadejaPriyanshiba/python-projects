111. 74. What is a significant practical limitation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) in very large state spaces, especially when the solution is deep?
(a) It may not find the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
(b) It is susceptible to getting stuck in infinite loops even with a visited set.
(c) Its memory requirements can become prohibitive due to storing all nodes at the current level.
(d) It requires a precise heuristic function, which is not always available.

112. 68. When applying Breadth-First Search (BFS) to a state space search problem, what does each "level" of the search tree primarily represent?
(a) The accumulated cost of reaching that state.
(b) The number of steps (or moves) taken from the initial state.
(c) The heuristic value of the state.
(d) The total number of nodes visited so far.

118. 93. In Steepest-Ascent Hill Climbing, how is the next state chosen from the current state's neighbors?
