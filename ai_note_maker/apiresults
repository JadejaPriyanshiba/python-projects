0.) Definition and types of determinants (cofactor, adjugate, etc.)
Avoid technical jargon as much as possible, but use precise mathematical language where necessary. 
End with a summary of the key takeaways or applications of the concept in practice.


1.) Properties of determinants (additivity, permutation)
Provide exercises or practice problems at the end to help reinforce the concepts covered in the explanation.


2.) Calculating determinants using cofactor expansion or minors
Consider using diagrams, charts, or formulas to illustrate concepts visually.


3.) Applications of determinants in solving systems of linear equations (Cramer's rule), volume calculations for parallelopipeds and solids, matrix algebra, etc.
Use diagrams, illustrations, or charts to clarify complex concepts where possible. 
End with a summary of the main takeaways and benefits of learning about determinants in mathematics.
